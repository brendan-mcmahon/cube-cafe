# TODO Items
## Game Functionality

  - [ ] Chalkify/improve the manager track

## UI Improvements
- [ ] Have a Statistics modal that shows the stats for the game (use Endgame or refactor)
  - [ ] Maybe not a modal, but something hidable that shows up on the side
- [ ] Add a "reset game" button to the settings
- [ ] Confirm button for "quitting" maybe? Or does it auto save anyway? Idk.

- [ ] add tool tips for the various actions

## Settings to add:

## Data Collection Features
- [ ] Data View with all of the games data aggregated and assessed
- [ ] Add a "play this game again" button to the end game screen
